3. Phase 3: Develop the user interface using Django, integrating components from Phases 1 and 2.
4. Phase 4: Write comprehensive documentation, develop and run unit tests, and prepare deployment scripts.
5. Phase 5: Continuously refine the project structure and follow best practices throughout the development process.

Keep the project simple and trackable and understandable and modular. Keep it modular so I can use the modules separately.
