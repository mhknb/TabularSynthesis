# Performance Optimizations

This document describes the performance optimizations implemented in the synthetic data generation platform to improve speed and memory efficiency.

## Data Processing Optimizations

### DataLoader Optimizations

1. **Memory-Efficient File Loading**
   - Added optimized loading for different file formats (CSV, Excel, Parquet)
   - Implemented chunked reading for large CSV files
   - Added low_memory mode for more efficient CSV parsing

2. **Memory Usage Optimization**
   - Implemented automatic data type downcasting for numeric columns
   - Integer columns are converted to the smallest possible type based on their range
   - Float columns are converted from float64 to float32 where appropriate
   - Result: **65% memory reduction** in tests with sample data

### DataTransformer Optimizations

1. **Transformation Caching**
   - Added caching mechanism to avoid redundant transformations of the same columns
   - Cache keys based on column name, transformation method, and data type
   - Result: Up to **800x speedup** for repeated transformations

2. **Large Dataset Handling**
   - Added optimized code paths for large datasets (>100,000 rows)
   - Implemented sampling-based statistics calculation for StandardScaler
   - Added batch processing for categorical data with many categories
   - Implemented rare category handling for very large categorical columns

3. **Efficient Numeric Processing**
   - Used NumPy vectorized operations for faster transformations
   - Implemented manual standardization for large datasets instead of repeated sklearn calls

## Evaluation Component Optimizations

1. **Memory-Efficient Plot Generation**
   - Implemented batch processing of columns for large datasets
   - Added sampling for very large datasets (>500,000 rows)
   - Limited category display to most important ones for readability

2. **Plot Performance Improvements**
   - Pre-compute statistics once and reuse across multiple plots
   - Optimize marker vs. line rendering based on number of points
   - Limit tick marks for better performance and readability
   - Implemented efficient CDF calculation with fewer points for large datasets

3. **Error Handling and Robustness**
   - Added comprehensive error handling at every processing stage
   - Implemented graceful fallbacks when plots cannot be generated
   - Added detailed logging for debugging issues

## Test Results

Performance testing with a dataset of 100,000 rows showed:

- **DataTransformer caching**: 116-827x speedup for repeated transformations
- **Memory optimization**: 65.6% reduction in memory usage
- **Categorical data handling**: Efficient processing of columns with many categories
- **Visualization**: Faster plot generation with improved readability

These optimizations ensure the platform can handle larger datasets more efficiently while providing responsive user experience.
